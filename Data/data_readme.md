# Behavioral data files

## Behavioral data (Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 6, Fig 7)

Files are matlab structures. Each element in the array is a separate session, with fieldnames consisting of high-level experiment data. Vector fields are split by trials, consisting of information on the lever names, lever times, and cue information.


## Kinematic data (Fig 6, Fig 7)

Kinematic data is preprocessed and aligned to behavioral data. Only trials in CUE and WM that match the automatic sequence are selected. For raw data across all recorded trials and different sequences, please contact corresponding author.


## Ephys Data (Fig 4, Fig 5)

Trial averaged ephys data is uploaded here:
Individual sessions (with spike times, trials, and kinematics) are uploaded here:
